###### Welcome to the public space of the Research Support Group at the University of Alberta

## HPC cluster/unix tools
#### This session will teach you how to run and control programs understand what is happening, and diagnose some problems on Unix/Linux systems

High performance computing (HPC) clusters are composed Linux machines, understanding and controlling work on a cluster is extension of the skills in doing the same on a Linux machine. 
You will learn how to tell how much memory, how many open files, how much disk IO, Iops, network traffic does a program use. 
How to tell much resources exist on a computer and how busy it is currently and which program are using these resources. 
We will then extend the same tools and techniques for jobs running on a cluster.
